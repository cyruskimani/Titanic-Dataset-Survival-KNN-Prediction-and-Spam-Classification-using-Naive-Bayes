# Titanic-Dataset-Survival-KNN-Prediction-and-Spam-Classification-using-Naive-Bayes
This repository contains a KNN Prediction for Survival on the Titanic and a Naive Bayes Classifier for Spam Messages.

# 1.Titanic Dataset KNN Prediction.

KNN is a supervised learning algorithm that predics the outcome of a test dataset based on insights drawn from a training dataset. The algorithm searches for a k-number of nearest neighbours from the train dataset and assigns the dependent variable to the label with the highest number of occurrences.

For this project, the task was to predict the likelyhood of a passenger on the titanic to survive based on several factors described in the dataset.

## Source of data:

a) Train dataset: https://archive.org/download/train5_202002/train%20%285%29.csv

b) Test dataset:https://archive.org/download/test1_202002/test%20%281%29.csv

## Input to the code:

a)Train Dataset.

b)Count of folds (k) for k-fold cross validation.

c)Number of nearest neighbors i.e. k-NN.

## Output:

a)Each test instance and respective prediction.

b)Overall accuracy for each model.

# 2. Naive Bayes Classifier

The supervised Naive bayes classifier was implemented on a spam dataset to predict the likelyhood of a message to be ham or spam. 

## Source of data:

Spam dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase

## Input to the code:

a)Train Dataset.

b)Classifier: Gaussian Naive Bayes.

## Output:

a)Each test instance and respective prediction.

b)Overall accuracy for each model.
